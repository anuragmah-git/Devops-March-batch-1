# What is Docker compose

	Docker compose
	--------------
		- Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
		  With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, 
		  you create and start all the services from your configuration.
		- tool for defining & running multi-container docker applications
		- use yaml files to configure application services (docker-compose.yml)
		- can start all services with a single command : docker compose up
		- can stop all services with a single command : docker compose down
		- can scale up selected services when required : --scale <service-name>=4

# Installation Steps
====================

Step.1) Check it is already installed or not using below command.
 
	- $ docker-compose -v

Step.2) Install docker-compose on Linux machine
  
  	# sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Step.3) Apply executable permissions to the binary:
	
	# sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Step.4) Create docker compose file at any location on your system
	
	- $ touch docker-compose.yml
Note - After creating a compose file check the compose file reference in docker compose reference documentation in the compose file reference.

Step.5) Write a databse services in the yml file,  see below ex.

	- vim docker-compose.yml
		
		services:

		  containername:
		          image: nginx

		  containername:
		    	  image: redis

Step.6) Check the validity of file by command
	
	- $ docker-compose config

      => If you got Invalid Error then add version in the file, see below ex.

		version: '2'

		services:

		  web:
		    image: nginx

		  database:
		    image: redis
 

Step.7) Run docker-compose.yml file by command
   	
	- $ docker-compose up -d (Note: -d is use for running in backgroud mode)


Step.8) Bring down application by command
   	
	- $ docker-compose down

Step.9) If you give any other name to docker compose file and you want to run or delete the created content then use below command.
	
	- $ docker-compose -f compose-file-name.yml up -d
	- $ docker-compose -f compose-file-name.yml down

Note - you can write this file in json format also and after that, just save file in the .json extension and run the file using same command.



# How to scale services using docker-compose

	—scale
		$ docker-compose up -d --scale containername=4

	(Note- --scale:- It is command for scaling
	       =4 :- It creates 4 database containers for one application using one server.)
